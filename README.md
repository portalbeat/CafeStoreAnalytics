## ðŸš€ Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Robust cleaning of raw sales data using Python to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and data type conversions.
- **Data Storage**: Secure and scalable storage of cleaned sales transaction data in Azure PostgreSQL.
- **Data Transformation**: SQL queries for data aggregation and preparation for analysis.
- **Key Metric Calculation**: Total revenue, total orders, average order value (AOV), and quantity sold.
- **Performance Analysis**: Identification of top-selling items, revenue by order channel and payment method.
- **Trend Analysis**: Monthly revenue trends, daily revenue trends, and rolling averages.
- **Dashboarding**: Interactive and insightful dashboards built with Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data cleaning, transformation, and loading using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `SQLAlchemy`
- **Azure PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing cleaned data
- **SQL**: Data querying and metric creation
- **Power BI**: Dashboard building and visualization

---

## ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning (Python)

The raw sales data was thoroughly cleaned using Python and the pandas library. Key data cleaning steps included:

- Loading Data
- Column Renaming and Standardization
- Handling Missing/Invalid Values
- Data Type Conversion
- Data Revitalization
- Connecting to Database
- Data Loading

## ðŸ§® SQL Analysis Overview

A series of SQL queries were developed to extract meaningful insights from the `cafesales` dataset. These queries focused on several key areas:

- Basic Data Exploration
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Product Performance & Revenue Streams
- Time-Based Trends

---

## ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard

The project culminates in an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes the insights derived from the SQL analysis. The dashboard is designed to provide an executive summary and detailed views of:

- Revenue
- Product performance
- Sales channels
- Payment methods
- Monthly trends
